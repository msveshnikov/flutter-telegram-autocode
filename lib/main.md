# Messenger Clone - Main Application File

## Overview

This file (`lib/main.dart`) serves as the entry point for the Messenger Clone application. It sets up the main application structure, including dependency injection, routing, and the initial authentication flow.

The application uses Flutter for the frontend and implements a multi-provider architecture for state management and service injection. It includes screens for authentication, home, chat, and user profile.

## Main Function

```dart
void main() {
  // ...
}
```

The `main()` function is the entry point of the application. It sets up the provider architecture and runs the app.

### Key Components:
- Uses `MultiProvider` to inject services into the widget tree
- Provides `AuthService`, `ChatService`, and `WebSocketService` to the entire application
- Initializes and runs the `MyApp` widget

## MyApp Class

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // ...
}
```

`MyApp` is the root widget of the application. It sets up the overall app configuration.

### Key Features:
- Defines the app title as "Messenger Clone"
- Sets up the primary theme color and font family
- Configures named routes for navigation
- Uses `AuthWrapper` as the initial home screen

## AuthWrapper Class

```dart
class AuthWrapper extends StatelessWidget {
  // ...
}
```

`AuthWrapper` manages the authentication state and initial loading of the application.

### Functionality:
- Initializes `AuthService`, `ChatService`, and `WebSocketService`
- Displays a loading indicator while services are initializing
- Listens to authentication state changes
- Redirects to `HomeScreen` if user is authenticated, otherwise shows `AuthScreen`

## Dependencies

The file imports several custom services and screens:

- `AuthService`: Manages user authentication
- `ChatService`: Handles chat-related operations
- `WebSocketService`: Manages real-time communication
- `HomeScreen`: The main screen for authenticated users
- `ChatScreen`: For displaying individual chats
- `ProfileScreen`: For user profile management
- `AuthScreen`: Handles user login and registration

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (check `pubspec.yaml`)
2. Run the app using `flutter run` command or through an IDE

## Project Structure Integration

This file is central to the application's structure:

- It initializes services defined in the `services/` directory
- Sets up navigation to screens defined in the `screens/` directory
- Acts as the bridge between the Flutter frontend and the backend services

## Notes

- The application uses a `Provider` package for dependency injection and state management
- Authentication state is managed through a stream, allowing real-time updates to the UI
- The app supports multiple screens with a defined routing system
- Theme customization is centralized in this file for consistent styling across the app
